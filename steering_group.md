# N8 CIR Steering Group - Terms of Reference

## Background
As in the previous incarnation of N8 CIR (N8 HPC), the Steering Group is the main mechanism for governing the HPC 
Centre of Excellence and the Tier 2 NICE provision.  Reporting to it are both a Project Director Group, 
comprising the Director, the Deputy Director, Technical Director, Programme Manager, Research Infrastructure Engineer 
Theme Lead and Research Software Engineer Theme Lead, and a Project Working Group, comprising the technical 
representatives from each of the partner institutions. 

## Terms of Reference
The Steering Group provides oversight of the operation of the Centre of Excellence and the Bede facility, including 
setting the overall direction of the activities, developing strategy and agreeing policies to ensure the success of 
the Centre and alignment with the plans and objectives of the N8 partners. Specific responsibilities of the Group 
will include:
- ensuring delivery of the objectives of the Centre and any computational facilities
- planning for the financial and operational sustainability of the Centre;
- monitoring the budget and KPI performance;
- agreeing policies for usage and development of relevant computational facilities;
- agreeing plans for publicising and marketing the activities of the Centre;
- identifying and promoting new opportunities to develop N8 CIR in line with the Centre's strategy
- reporting to the N8 Strategic Executive Group (SEG)

## Membership
Each partner institution shall appoint one member of the Steering Group to act as its representative. Only members 
of the Steering Group may vote. 

Each institution can also have an observer on the Steering Group who will act as deputy if the member for that 
institution cannot attend. Each active CIR theme may have an observer on the Steering Group.  Observers will not 
have voting privileges unless acting as deputy for a member.  There shall also be a non-voting project manager in 
attendance.

The membership and the Terms of Reference of the Steering Group will be reviewed annually.  Members of the community 
may put themselves forward as the Steering Group member for their institution (if it is a partner) through a link on 
the N8 CIR Governance website page but only their institution may appoint.

## Responsibilities
Each Steering Group member should:
- engage with their local community ahead of each meeting to gain feedback and/or raise topics to N8 CIR,
- prepare for each meeting beforehand, and nominate a deputy if they cannot attend themselves,
- have and maintain a good liaison with their PVC-R or equivalent and other university stakeholders. 

## Frequency of Meetings
The Steering Group meetings should be held quarterly with interim meetings if required.  The meeting will be 
deemed quorate if five institutional representatives are present.
